# Web3 Token Factory Engine

A professional Web3 reference project that demonstrates how blockchain token creation systems can be modeled using clean and modular Web3 architecture.

This repository focuses on simulating token generation, managing token metadata, configuring total supply, and generating analytics reports in a beginner-friendly and production-style format.
